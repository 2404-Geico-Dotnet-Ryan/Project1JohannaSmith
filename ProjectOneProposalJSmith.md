Proposal:

I intend to create a travel agency application.
- There will be users looking to plan a trip.
- Users will create a unique login and password, and they can only see their specific trips.
- At any point they can save and exit / log back in and continue (maybe?)
- Users will be prompted to make choices that will ultimately lead to the details of their trip.
    - Such as:
        - Dates --updating to season
        - Budget --I'm wondering if I should remove this, or make them a range, or maybe just make them all pretty low. because I would have to add like 2 trips for every filtering question. OR- should I filter after every answer, and just not present any more questions once we are down to only 1 trip? This might be the way.
        - Number of travelers
        - Location of Departure
        - Type of Travel
            - Air
            - Train
            - Car
            - Cruise
        - Passport status
        - Interests
            - Climate
            - Activities
            - Children
        - Others?
- Once all data has been collected, Users will be presented with all trips that qualify based on their conditions.
    - The trips will include specifics on dates, departure location, type of travel, destination location, and details on what they can/will do at the destination. 
- If more than one trip qualifies, the user will be prompted to make a selection to choose their dream vacation! One of our experienced agents will contact them to complete the booking process. 
- OR they can save their trips and decide later!

<!-- The application should be a C# Console Application
The application should build and run
The application should interact with users, and provide some console UI
The application should allow for multiple users to log in and persist their data
The application should demonstrate good input validation
The application should persist data to a SQL Server DB
The application should communicate to DB via ADO.NET or Entity Framework Core
The application should have unit tests
Nice to Have
n-tier architecture
dependency injection
The application should log errors and system events to a file or a DB table
Basic user authentication and authorization (admins vs normal users with passwords)

For this project, dont worry about the admin side. Just pre-populate some data (eventually) for users to see and not stress the admin part. Track the trips and mkae this the data that is specific to each user. As in, if I login with User X I dont see User Y's trips booked (when looking under like My Trips - or something)

What I'd like (sent by COB: Thursday - 5/9):
		- Via a txt file, chat communication, or actual
		models created:
			- Each model that will exist in your app
                Service Layer
                    - is responsible for performing Business Logic, which includes things like filtering, searching, sorting, validating, etc. 
                    - Would do so upon the data that was retrieved by the Repository Layer. 
			- All properties of each model listed out
			- Properties added in models to define their
			relationship to each other (Composition) -->
