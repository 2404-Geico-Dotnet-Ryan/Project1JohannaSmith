Proposal:

I intend to create a travel agency application.
- There will be users looking to plan a trip.
- There will be admins who can add/remove trip options.
- Users will create a unique login and password.
- At any point they can save and exit / log back in and continue (maybe?)
- Users will be prompted to make choices that will ultimately lead to the details of their trip.
    - Such as:
        - Dates
        - Budget
        - Number of travelers
        - Location of Departure
        - Type of Travel
            - Air
            - Train
            - Car
            - Cruise
        - Passport status
        - Interests
            - Climate
            - Activities
            - Children
        - Others?
- Once all data has been collected, Users will be presented with all trips that qualify based on their conditions.
    - The trips will include specifics on dates, departure location, type of travel, destination location, and details on what they can/will do at the destination. 
- If more than one trip qualifies, the user will be prompted to make a selection to choose their dream vacation! One of our experienced agents will contact them to complete the booking process. 
- OR they can save their trips and decide later!
