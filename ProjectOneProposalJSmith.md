Proposal:

I intend to create a travel agency application.
- There will be users looking to plan a trip.
- There will be admins who can add/remove trip options.
- Users will be prompted to make choices that will ultimately lead to the details of their trip.
    - Such as:
        -Dates
        -Budget
        -Number of travelers
        -Location of Departure
        -Type of Travel
            -Air
            -Train
            -Car
            -Cruise
        -Passport status
        -Interests
            -Climate
            -Activities
            -Children
        -Others?
-Once all data has been collected, Users will be presented with all trips that qualify based on their conditions.
    - The trips will include specifics on dates, departure location, type of travel, destination location, and details on what they can/will do at the destination. 
-If more than one trip qualifies, the user will be prompted to make a selection to choose their dream vacation!
